#🚘 Vehicle Number Plate Detection & Recognition: 
This project is all about automatically detecting and recognizing vehicle number plates using image processing and computer vision.
It’s designed to make tasks like traffic monitoring, parking management, toll collection, and vehicle tracking easier by detecting license plates from images or live video.
We built this using Python, OpenCV, Tkinter combining GUI design, image processing.


## 💡 What This Project Does
This system can:
Detect and localize number plates from vehicle images.
Extract characters using segmentation techniques.
Recognize the plate number using OCR methods.
Work under different lighting or environmental conditions.
Provide a simple, interactive GUI to process images step by step.


## 🧠 How It Works (In Simple Terms)
The process goes through these main steps:
Upload an image – You select a vehicle image from your system.
Preprocess it – The image is converted to grayscale and cleaned up to remove noise.
Detect the plate – Using Haar Cascade Classifier, the system identifies where the number plate is.
Segment the characters – It extracts each character separately for recognition.
Display results – You can see the localized number plate and extracted text.


## 🔭 Main Modules:
read.py Upload and view vehicle image.
preprocessing.py Convert to grayscale and remove noise.
seg.py Extract features from the plate.
locate.py Detect and draw bounding box on the number plate.
main.py Tkinter GUI that connects all the steps.


## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies:
Language – Python
Libraries – OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy, Thinkter
Algorithm – Haar Cascade Classifier 
IDE – VS Code / PyCharm
OS – windows 10 / Higher 


## Required Packages:

## How to Run the Project: 
1.	Clone the Repository 
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection.git
cd Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection

2.	Install Dependency 
pip install -r requirements.txt  

3.	Run the Main Application 
python main.py

4.	Use the GUI 
Click on the Input image 
Then go through each step 
    Preprocessing 
    Segmentation 
    Feature Extraction 
    Number Plate Detection

    
## 🎗️Future Improvement
